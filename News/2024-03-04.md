### [How to hire low experience, high potential people (worktopia.substack.com) | HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39288669) | commenter> | 4 Bayesian questions

> smeeth 12 hours ago | unvote | prev | next [–]  
> 
> People's intuitions around hiring aren't Bayesian enough. I think a good process reduces down to something like:  
> 
> -   Are they smart? (understands quickly + communicates effectively)
> -   Are they cool? (won't put poison in the keurig + pleasant to be around)
> -   Are they high energy? (initiative + action bias)
> -   Do they have the experience needed to be successful in the role?
> 
> Those are pretty strong priors for success. If you find someone with all the above, you've got an ~80% chance of a hit. No need to over-complicate.  
> 
> In my experience, adding more boxes tends to index towards box-checkers who grew up wealthy. That's how you miss the hyper-smart/diligent state school kids who happened to spend their summers working instead of doing model UN.
